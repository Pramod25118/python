Tuple:
Tuple is almost same as lists, it is Immutable(means can not change values)
round brackets defines tuple, iteration in tuple is faster than list means it will increases the speed of the execution
To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.
Ex:
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))
#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))

tup = (32, 23, 34, 22, 45, 56)
I/P:   tup
O/P: (32, 23, 34, 22, 45, 56)
I/P: tup[1]
O/P: 23
I/P: tup.count(32)
O/P: 1
I/P: tup[2] = 11
O/P: WILL GET ERROR
    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment : it means we can't change the value



Sets: collection of elements, used with flower brackets,  same as lists it never follows a sequence, when elements are repeated it will not rewrite the same element again
and sets will not allow duplicate elements
Ex:
s={23, 45, 67, 89, 90, 33}
s
{33, 67, 23, 89, 90, 45}
s= {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 2}
s
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

we can use s.(dot) + trl&spacebar for other extensions for diffeent purpose
